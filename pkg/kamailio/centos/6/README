The following modules are not included in CentOS 6 builds because they have
dependencies that cannot be met by the standard CentOS YUM repos, require
complex compilation steps, or are obsolete.

If you need any of these modules you will need to find (and possibly build) and
install the dependencies and then do a manual build of Kamailio.
