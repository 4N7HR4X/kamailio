This directory contains the Kamailio generic database support library.
The library should be used by all modules willing to communicate with a
database. Kamailio can then switch from one database to another simply by
loading a different database support module. Directory example contains a 
very simple example how to use the interface. Directory doc contains the API
documentation.

Note that you can use sip-router with 2 different database interfaces:
 ser and kamailio.
