1. Overview

   The module replaces the common system dns resolver functions from core
   with the DNSSEC wrappers provided by libval. Practically, by loading
   the module, Kamailio will make use of extensions to DNS which provide
   origin authentication of DNS data, authenticated denial of existence,
   and data integrity.

   There is no module parameter that should be set nor fuction that has to
   be executed by the configuration file. Existing SIP server deployments
   can be updated to use DNSSEC by loading this module and setting
   appropriate DNS server to the operating system.

   Installing libval can be done from https://www.dnssec-tools.org.

   More details about DNSSEC are available at:
